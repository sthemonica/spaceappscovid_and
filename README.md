 Page created for specific purposes of the NASA Hackathon - Space Apps Covid-19 Challenge.

In the challenge, we decided to test two networks with our small database.
The data found in the datasets are the same, their formatting in the table has a small header change, in RBF it is not necessary to use a header, in MLP yes, it is worth remembering that this is not a general case, the composite networks here they need this treatment.

The results of the network were satisfactory due to the amount of data we put in, one of the options is to insert more data so that the networks are more accurate.
